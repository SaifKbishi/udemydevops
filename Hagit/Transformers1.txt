Transformers is a series of science fiction action films based on the Transformers franchise.[note 1] Michael Bay directed the first five live action films: Transformers (2007), Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Dark of the Moon (2011), Age of Extinction (2014), and The Last Knight (2017),[1][2][3] and has served as a producer for subsequent films. A sixth film Bumblebee, directed by Travis Knight, was released in 2018, while a seventh film, Rise of the Beasts, directed by Steven Caple Jr., was released in 2023.

The series has been distributed by Paramount Pictures, and DreamWorks Pictures worked on the first two films. While the Transformers film series has received negative to mixed reception, Bumblebee received positive reviews. Despite its critical reception, the Transformers film series has generally been successful at the box office, with Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction grossing over $1 billion each; the latter was the highest-grossing film of 2014. It is the 14th-highest-grossing film series, with a total of $5.28 billion grossed over seven films to date.
